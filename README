#Mobile Manipulation on a KUKA Youbot

Mobile manipulators are increasingly being used in industries and warehouse
maintenance and extensive research is carried out to increase their accuracy and
efficiency.
The system we have developed is able to recognise objects, estimate the
pose, and manipulate them irrespective of their orientation. The system is also able to
perform simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM),
navigate autonomously in the mapped environment by avoiding static and dynamic obstacles, search and
manipulate the object in places which are defined by the user.
This work details the implementation of object recognition, pose estimation,
manipulation and navigation using Kuka Youbot, Microso
ft KinectOne and LiDAR Hokuyo URG-04lx. The system uses Robot Operating System (ROS) indigo running
in Ubuntu 14.04 and uses certain developed packages for object recognition, mapping
and navigation
